What is HTML?
	HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
	HTML describes the structure of a Web pages.
	The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document.
	Using latest HTML5 standard.
	An HTML page will validate without the <html> and <body> tags
	The HTML <head> tag can also be omitted.
		Browsers will add all elements before <body>, to a default <head> element.
	You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers. <html lang="en-us">
	There is no difference between the .htm and .html file extensions! Both will be treated as HTML by any web browser and web server.
	
Notes:
	JS: JavaScript makes HTML pages more dynamic and interactive.
	Responsive web design is about creating web pages that look good on all devices!
	A responsive web design will automatically adjust for different screen sizes and viewports.
	Bootstrap is popular CSS framework is Bootstrap. Bootstrap uses HTML, CSS and jQuery to make responsive web pages.

Elements:
	> Headings
	> Paragraphs
	> Links using anchor tag
	> Image using img tag: <img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket">
		Always Specify alt, width, and height for Images
			<img src="html5.gif" alt="HTML5" style="width:128px;height:128px">

What is an HTML Element?
	HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.
	An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.
	Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!:
		The HTML <br> element defines a line break.
		Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph.

HTML is Not Case Sensitive:
	HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.

HTML Attributes:
	HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.
	All HTML elements can have attributes.
	Attributes are always specified in the start tag.
	Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value".


HTML Horizontal Rules:
	The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.

The HTML <pre> Element:
	The pre tag preserves both spaces and line breaks.
	<pre>
	   My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

	   My Bonnie lies over the sea.

	   My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
	   
	   Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
	</pre>


HTML Formatting Elements:
	Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:
		<b> - Bold text or <strong> - Important text
		<i> - Italic text or <em> - Emphasized text
		<mark> - Marked text (highlight text with color)
		<small> - Smaller text
		<del> - Deleted text (Strikethrough Text)
		<ins> - Inserted text (Browsers will usually underline inserted text)
		<sub> - Subscript text
		<sup> - Superscript text

HTML Comment/Multi-line Comment Tag:
	<!-- Write your comments here -->
	Hide Inline Content:
		<p>This <!-- great text --> is a paragraph.</p>
		
HTML Colors:
	HTML colors are specified with predefined color names, or with RGB, HEX, or RGBA values.
	RGB/RGBA:
		Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color with a value between 0 and 255.
		This means that there are 256 x 256 x 256 = 16777216 possible colors!
		An RGB color value represents RED, GREEN, and BLUE light sources. i.e. rgb(red, green, blue) or rgb(255, 0, 0) = RED
		To display black, set all color parameters to 0, like this: rgb(0, 0, 0).
		To display white, set all color parameters to 255, like this: rgb(255, 255, 255).
		An RGBA color value is an extension of RGB with an Alpha channel (opacity), i.e. rgba(red, green, blue, alpha) or rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.5)
		The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all)
	HEX:
		A hexadecimal color is specified with: #RRGGBB, where the RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) hexadecimal integers specify the components of the color.
		Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255).
		For example, #ff0000 is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (ff), and the other two (green and blue) are set to 00.
		To display black, set all color parameters to 00, like this: #000000.
		To display white, set all color parameters to ff, like this: #ffffff.
		
HTML Links(hyperlinks =  electronic document on a computer that is connected to another electronic document):
	An unvisited link is underlined and blue
	A visited link is underlined and purple
	An active link is underlined and red
	target attribute with value as _blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab.
	Absolute URLs (a full web address) vs. Relative URLs  (without the "https://www" part or a local URL)
		Absolute: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">HTML tutorial</a>
		Relative: <a href="/html/default.asp">HTML tutorial</a>
	Link to an Email Address: <a href="mailto:someone@example.com" title="Email Address">Send email</a>
	Title helps while hovering the mouse.
	
HTML Links - Create Bookmarks:
	HTML links can be used to create bookmarks, so that readers can jump to specific parts of a web page.
		First, use the id attribute to create a bookmark i.e. <h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2>
		Then, add a link to the bookmark i.e. <a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>
		
HTML Favicon:
	A favicon is a small image displayed next to the page title in the browser tab.

HTML Tables:
	<table>
		<caption>Company Details</caption>
		<tr> --- row ---
		  <th>Company</th> --- cell ---
		  <th>Contact</th> --- cell ---
		  <th>Country</th> --- cell ---
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td>Alfreds Futterkiste</td>
		  <td>Maria Anders</td>
		  <td>Germany</td>
		</tr>
    </table>
	
	td: table data
	tr: table row
	th: table header
	
Padding: padding is the space between the edges and the content.
	 The CSS padding property defines a padding (space) between the text and the border.
	 
	 p {
	   border: 2px solid powderblue;
	   padding: 30px;
	 }

HTML Lists:
	Unordered HTML List [bullets (small black circles) by default]:
	<ul>
	  <li>Coffee</li>
	  <li>Tea</li>
	  <li>Milk</li>
	</ul>
	
	Ordered HTML List [marked with numbers by default]:
	<ol>
	  <li>Coffee</li>
	  <li>Tea</li>
	  <li>Milk</li>
	</ol>
	
	HTML Description Lists:
	<dl>
	  <dt>Coffee</dt>
	  <dd>- black hot drink</dd>
	  <dt>Milk</dt>
	  <dd>- white cold drink</dd>
	</dl>
	
	dl: description list, dt: defines the term (name), dd: describes each term
	
URL - Uniform Resource Locator:
	A URL is another word for a web address.
	A URL can be composed of
		words (e.g. w3schools.com)
		or 
		an Internet Protocol (IP) address (e.g. 192.68.20.50)
	Most people enter the name when surfing, because names are easier to remember than numbers.
	Web browsers request pages from web servers by using a URL.
	
	A web address like https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp follows these syntax rules:
		scheme://prefix.domain:port/path/filename
		
		Explanation:
			scheme - defines the type of Internet service (most common is http or https)
			prefix - defines a domain prefix (default for http is www)
			domain - defines the Internet domain name (like w3schools.com)
			port - defines the port number at the host (default for http is 80)
			path - defines a path at the server (If omitted: the root directory of the site)
			filename - defines the name of a document or resource
			
		Common URL Schemes:
			Scheme: http (HyperText Transfer Protocol)	Used for: Common web pages. Not encrypted
			Scheme: https (Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol)	Used for: Common web pages. Secure web pages. Encrypted
			Scheme: ftp (File Transfer Protocol)	Used for: Downloading or uploading files
			
		URL Encoding:
			URLs can only be sent over the Internet using the ASCII character-set. The default character-set in HTML5 is UTF-8.
				HTML charset Attribute: <meta charset="UTF-8">
			To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know which character set to use.
			If a URL contains characters outside the ASCII set, the URL has to be converted.
			URL encoding replaces non-ASCII characters with a "%" followed by hexadecimal digits.
			URLs cannot contain spaces. URL encoding normally replaces a space with a plus (+) sign, or %20.
			
			character-set: ASCII character-set, UTF-8. ANSI etc.
			The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the UTF-8 character set, which covers almost all of the characters and symbols (also Symbols, Emojis) in the world!
			
HTML Block and Inline Elements:
	Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is:
		There are two display values: block and inline.
		A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available.
		An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary.
		Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div> and many others (<table>, <form> etc).
		<span> element is the common inline elements and many others (<a>, <img> etc).
		An inline element cannot contain a block-level element!
		
HTML class Attribute:
	The HTML class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element. The class attribute can be used on any HTML element.
	Multiple HTML elements can share the same class. The class name is case sensitive
	The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. 
	It can also be used by a JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name.
	
	<h1>My <span class="note">Important</span> Heading</h1>
	.note {
	  font-size: 120%;
	  color: red;
	}
	
HTML id Attribute:
	The HTML id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element.
	You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document. The id name is case sensitive!
	The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. 
	It is also used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id.
	The id name must contain at least one character, cannot start with a number, and must not contain whitespaces (spaces, tabs, etc.).
	
	<h1 id="myHeader">My Header</h1>
	#myHeader {
	  background-color: lightblue;
	  color: black;
	}
	
HTML Iframes:
	An HTML iframe is used to display a web page within a web page.
	<iframe src="url" title="description"></iframe>
	Can we display a web page inside a web page or Is nesting of webpages possible? YES!
	
HTML File Paths:
	<img src="picture.jpg"> Description: The "picture.jpg" file is located in the same folder as the current page
	<img src="images/picture.jpg"> Description: The "picture.jpg" file is located in the images folder in the current folder
	<img src="/images/picture.jpg">	Description: The "picture.jpg" file is located in the images folder at the root of the current web
	<img src="../picture.jpg"> Description: The "picture.jpg" file is located in the folder one level up from the current folder
	
HTML - The Head Element:
	The HTML <head> element is a container for the following elements: <title>, <style>, <meta>, <link>, and <script>
	The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.
	HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.
	
		The <title> element:
			is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab
			provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
			displays a title for the page in search engine-results
			
		Setting The Viewport using the HTML <meta> Element:
			The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device - it will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.
			
			<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
			
			This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.
				The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).
				The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
				
HTML Forms:
	An HTML form is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to a server for processing.
	<input type="text">	Description: Displays a single-line text input field
	<input type="radio">	Description: Displays a radio button (for selecting one of many choices)
	<input type="checkbox">	Description: Displays a checkbox (for selecting zero or more of many choices)
	<input type="submit">	Description: Displays a submit button (for submitting the form)
	<input type="button">	Description: Displays a clickable button
	<input type="password"> Description: defines a password field (The characters in a password field are masked (shown as asterisks or circles)).
	<input type="date"> Description: used for input fields that should contain a date (use the min and max attributes to add restrictions to dates).
	<input type="email"> Description: used for input fields that should contain an e-mail address (automatically validated when submitted).
	<input type="file"> Description: defines a file-select field and a "Browse" button for file uploads.
	<input type="number"> Description: defines a numeric input field
	(default width of an input field is 20 characters)
	
	Note: 1) The for attribute of the <label> tag should be equal to the id attribute of the <input> element to bind them together.
			 The <label> element is useful for screen-reader users
		  2) The name attribute specifies the name of an <input> element.
			 The name attribute is used to reference elements in a JavaScript, or to reference form data after a form is submitted.
		  3) When autocomplete is on, the browser automatically complete values based on values that the user has entered before.
		  4) The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted.
			 Usually, the form data is sent to a file on the server when the user clicks on the submit button.
			 In the below example, the form data is sent to a file called "action_page.php".
		  5) The <select> element defines a drop-down list. By default, the first item in the drop-down list is selected.
		  6) The <textarea> element defines a multi-line input field (a text area).
		  7) The <button> element defines a clickable button.
			 <button type="button" onclick="alert('Hello World!')">Click Me!</button>
		  8) The input value attribute specifies an initial value for an input field.
	
	The Method Attribute:
		Notes on GET (default):
			Appends the form data to the URL, in name/value pairs
			NEVER use GET to send sensitive data! (the submitted form data is visible in the URL!)
			The length of a URL is limited (2048 characters)
			Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result
			GET is good for non-secure data, like query strings in Google
		Notes on POST:
			Appends the form data inside the body of the HTTP request (the submitted form data is not shown in the URL)
			POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data.
			Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked

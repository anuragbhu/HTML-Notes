What is HTML?
	HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
	HTML describes the structure of a Web pages.
	The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document.
	Using latest HTML5 standard.

Elements:
	> Headings
	> Paragraphs
	> Links using anchor tag
	> Image using img tag: <img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket">

What is an HTML Element?
	HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.
	An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.
	Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!:
		The HTML <br> element defines a line break.
		Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph.

HTML is Not Case Sensitive:
	HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.

HTML Attributes:
	HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.
	All HTML elements can have attributes.
	Attributes are always specified in the start tag.
	Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value".


HTML Horizontal Rules:
	The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.

The HTML <pre> Element:
	The pre tag preserves both spaces and line breaks.
	<pre>
	   My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

	   My Bonnie lies over the sea.

	   My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
	   
	   Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
	</pre>


HTML Formatting Elements:
	Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:
		<b> - Bold text or <strong> - Important text
		<i> - Italic text or <em> - Emphasized text
		<mark> - Marked text (highlight text with color)
		<small> - Smaller text
		<del> - Deleted text (Strikethrough Text)
		<ins> - Inserted text (Browsers will usually underline inserted text)
		<sub> - Subscript text
		<sup> - Superscript text

HTML Comment/Multi-line Comment Tag:
	<!-- Write your comments here -->
	Hide Inline Content:
		<p>This <!-- great text --> is a paragraph.</p>
		
HTML Colors:
	HTML colors are specified with predefined color names, or with RGB, HEX, or RGBA values.
	RGB/RGBA:
		Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color with a value between 0 and 255.
		This means that there are 256 x 256 x 256 = 16777216 possible colors!
		An RGB color value represents RED, GREEN, and BLUE light sources. i.e. rgb(red, green, blue) or rgb(255, 0, 0) = RED
		To display black, set all color parameters to 0, like this: rgb(0, 0, 0).
		To display white, set all color parameters to 255, like this: rgb(255, 255, 255).
		An RGBA color value is an extension of RGB with an Alpha channel (opacity), i.e. rgba(red, green, blue, alpha) or rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.5)
		The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all)
	HEX:
		A hexadecimal color is specified with: #RRGGBB, where the RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) hexadecimal integers specify the components of the color.
		Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255).
		For example, #ff0000 is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (ff), and the other two (green and blue) are set to 00.
		To display black, set all color parameters to 00, like this: #000000.
		To display white, set all color parameters to ff, like this: #ffffff.
		
HTML Links(hyperlinks =  electronic document on a computer that is connected to another electronic document):
	An unvisited link is underlined and blue
	A visited link is underlined and purple
	An active link is underlined and red
	target attribute with value as _blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab.
	Absolute URLs (a full web address) vs. Relative URLs  (without the "https://www" part or a local URL)
		Absolute: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">HTML tutorial</a>
		Relative: <a href="/html/default.asp">HTML tutorial</a>
	Link to an Email Address: <a href="mailto:someone@example.com" title="Email Address">Send email</a>
	Title helps while hovering the mouse.
	
HTML Links - Create Bookmarks:
	HTML links can be used to create bookmarks, so that readers can jump to specific parts of a web page.
		First, use the id attribute to create a bookmark i.e. <h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2>
		Then, add a link to the bookmark i.e. <a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>
		
HTML Favicon:
	A favicon is a small image displayed next to the page title in the browser tab.

HTML Tables:
	<table>
		<caption>Company Details</caption>
		<tr> --- row ---
		  <th>Company</th> --- cell ---
		  <th>Contact</th> --- cell ---
		  <th>Country</th> --- cell ---
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td>Alfreds Futterkiste</td>
		  <td>Maria Anders</td>
		  <td>Germany</td>
		</tr>
    </table>
	
	td: table data
	tr: table row
	th: table header
	
Padding: padding is the space between the edges and the content.

HTML Lists:
	Unordered HTML List [bullets (small black circles) by default]:
	<ul>
	  <li>Coffee</li>
	  <li>Tea</li>
	  <li>Milk</li>
	</ul>
	
	Ordered HTML List [marked with numbers by default]:
	<ol>
	  <li>Coffee</li>
	  <li>Tea</li>
	  <li>Milk</li>
	</ol>
	
	HTML Description Lists:
	<dl>
	  <dt>Coffee</dt>
	  <dd>- black hot drink</dd>
	  <dt>Milk</dt>
	  <dd>- white cold drink</dd>
	</dl>
	
	dl: description list, dt: defines the term (name), dd: describes each term
	
URL - Uniform Resource Locator:
	A URL is another word for a web address.
	A URL can be composed of
		words (e.g. w3schools.com)
		or 
		an Internet Protocol (IP) address (e.g. 192.68.20.50)
	Most people enter the name when surfing, because names are easier to remember than numbers.
	Web browsers request pages from web servers by using a URL.
	
	A web address like https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp follows these syntax rules:
		scheme://prefix.domain:port/path/filename
		
		Explanation:
			scheme - defines the type of Internet service (most common is http or https)
			prefix - defines a domain prefix (default for http is www)
			domain - defines the Internet domain name (like w3schools.com)
			port - defines the port number at the host (default for http is 80)
			path - defines a path at the server (If omitted: the root directory of the site)
			filename - defines the name of a document or resource
			
		Common URL Schemes:
			Scheme: http (HyperText Transfer Protocol)	Used for: Common web pages. Not encrypted
			Scheme: https (Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol)	Used for: Common web pages. Secure web pages. Encrypted
			Scheme: ftp (File Transfer Protocol)	Used for: Downloading or uploading files
			
		URL Encoding:
			URLs can only be sent over the Internet using the ASCII character-set. The default character-set in HTML5 is UTF-8.
				HTML charset Attribute: <meta charset="UTF-8">
			To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know which character set to use.
			If a URL contains characters outside the ASCII set, the URL has to be converted.
			URL encoding replaces non-ASCII characters with a "%" followed by hexadecimal digits.
			URLs cannot contain spaces. URL encoding normally replaces a space with a plus (+) sign, or %20.
			
			character-set: ASCII character-set, UTF-8. ANSI etc.
			The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the UTF-8 character set, which covers almost all of the characters and symbols (also Symbols, Emojis) in the world!
